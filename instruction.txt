1. Library to route 
npm install react-router-dom --save



2nd library

now steps to remember 
1. import below to the index.js file or app.js 

2. but better to import in index.js
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';

3. MOST IMPORTANT rule is keep this import address above to your style file always

import libraries first and then your custome codes
